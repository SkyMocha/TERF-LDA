# Grievance articulation among TERF & Gender Critical communities on Twitter

### Abstract

Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism (TERF) or Gender Critcial (GC) feminism is a form of radical feminism whose core values are antithetical to feminist ideology. It focuses on support of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Heterosexual individuals (particularly women) meanwhile actively excluding trans individuals and specifically trans-feminine individuals. Trans individuals have been defined as a sort of boogie-man within this sect of radical feminism, as is the case with other prominent anti-trans groups. TERF ideology holds a loud megaphone, with prominent TERF activists including J.K. Rowling, The BBC, The Guardian, Dave Chapelle, and the LGBAlliance. The hashtag #SexNotGender regularly trends on Twitter advocating lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals to be attracted to their preferred sex (the bimodal in which someone is born) not gender (how one would identify). This proposal and eventual article hopes to add to existing literature on the topic, by exploring the main grievances articulated by TERF and Gender Critical communities. Through scraping Twitter posts from Twitter's API of three prominent TERF and Gender Critical accounts, and subsequent analysis using LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation), I will test the hypothesis that TERFs and Gender Critical individuals online are radicalized and further polarized through a few key thoughts and ideas:

1. A focus on reactions of disgust, fear, and anger. 
2. A false belief in the ‘silencing’ of TERF voices as marginalized and an ‘invasion’ of women’s spaces.
3. A perception there is a pervasiveness of trans women in societies’ institutions.
